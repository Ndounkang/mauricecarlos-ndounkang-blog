|Procedure/what was examined                                  |In Niigata Prefecture, from January to December 2017, 16 dead bodies found on land and originating in North Korea were autopsied. Autopsies revealed morphologically that 3 of 16 discovered cadavers had 3 intestinal worms. However, measurements were made and sizes ranged from approximately 9 to 13 cm long, 5 mm wide. Alignment and sequence analysis revealed that three of the nematodes found at Niigata were A. lumbricoides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|Conclusions/discovery                                       |  Nother concern is the contamination of the environment by A. Lumbricoides eggs on the beaches where cadavers are found. The high resistance of roundworm eggs and its long life for several years in the soil is associated with predisposition of marine currents to bring materials to the Japanese coast.The impact on health and the consequences of the epidemiological bridges produced by migration are directly related to the difference in prevalence between origin and destination and the size of the population that moves between different disease prevalence patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|Remaining questions                                          |Could it have an obvious means of transmitting Ascaris lumbricoides to people living around the Niigata prefecture of Japan; What might be the intensity of corpses-populations contamination and the tasks necessary for the survival of the population of this region?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
