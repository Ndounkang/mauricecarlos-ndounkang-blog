| Procedure/what was examined?                    | the study included the asthmatic children and healthy children, 2–15 years.The Blood samples were centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min, the serum collected and then transported on ice to the laboratory where they were stored at − 20°C until use. All sera were screened for anti-A. lumbricoides IgG antibodies.Sera who considered negative, suspect , and positive, for antibodies to A. lumbricoides.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Conclusions/discovery ?                         |According to the 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study, asthma was responsible for 495,100 deaths and approximately 23 million disability-adjusted life-years annually.The results showed that A. lumbricoides infection could be a potential risk factor for the development of asthma in children.The chronic exposures to ascariasis attenuate the severity of asthma; This result is in contrast with that, the sensitization to Ascaris was significantly related to increased severity of asthma among children in Costa Rica.The pathogenic mechanisms associated with Ascaris lumbricoides infection and asthma are indefined, and require further investigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Remaining questions?                | could  have a sensitivity of these parasitized children following an athmatic infection? could have children of previously infested with Ascaris and who have been hated athmatic? could we have the same results if the samples were stool                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
