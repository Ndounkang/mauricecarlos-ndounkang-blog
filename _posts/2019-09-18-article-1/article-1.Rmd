## Vocabulary 

| soil-transmitted helminth | A. lumbricoides is the most common soil-transmitted helminth, infecting more than 800 million patients globally  |
| ascariasis, as well as non-endemic regions | An absence of travel to endemic regions in an individual’s medical history does not exclude the possibility of ascariasis|
| effects of ascaris parasites against allergic diseases| Allergic sensitization to Ascaris, however, explained a significant proportion of wheezing among rural schoolchildren  |
| ascaris infectious tract remain a common problem in third-world countries| Poverty, illiteracy, poor hygiene, scarcity of potable water, humid  tropical climate, are all  factors associated with ascaris parasitic infestation|

| General topic?               
Ascaris infections occur worldwide, with current estimates suggesting that 1.4 billion people may be infected with this parasite.
The ascaris infections have been associated with significant disability and mortality, particularly in children                      |

| Procedure/what was examined? |

Soil- transmitted helminths (Ascaris lumbricoides) infections have been associated with a stronger regulation of the immune response that can be measured in vitro either at homeostatis (ie, that measured in unstimulated cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes.Data collected among a variety of populations worldwide show that there is no simple effect of more parasites, less allergy. The relationship is considerably more complex and depends not only on the local epidemiology of ascaris parasite in a particular population (endemicity and species of parasite present), but including host genetics and environmental factors.The researchers has emphasized also the importance of host genetics in determining host immune regulation, risk of atopy and susceptibility to STHs |

| Conclusions/discovery?       |

The impact of ascariasis on the inception and evolution of allergic diseases such as asthma is part of the long co- evolutionary history of helminths and humans and deserves more investigation. The sensitization to Ascaris (ie presence of anti‐Ascaris IgE) was a consistent risk factor for wheeze and asthma      |

| Remaining questions?         | 

Could this development of allergic sensitization to Ascaris lead to benign asthmatic disease ? |
